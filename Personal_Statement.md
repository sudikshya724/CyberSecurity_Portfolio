I am a passionate cybersecurity learner with a strong foundation in programming and communication. Iâ€™m especially driven by 
the mission to protect people's data and to promote awareness around cybersecurity risks. My interest in this field stems from 
a desire to not only defend systems against digital threats, but also help others understand how to stay secure in an increasingly 
connected world. By combining technical skills with clear, effective communication, I aim to support organizations in building safer,
more resilient digital environments.
