Summary of Risk Assessment
 Due to deficiencies in control implementation and adherence to important security standards (such as PCI DSS and GDPR), Botium Toys' current security posture is seriously at danger.  Risks that have been identified include poor asset management, no IDS, no disaster recovery plan, and insufficient encryption.  These problems might make private client information public, which would affect security and legal compliance.  To lower these risks, quick steps must be taken, such as enforcing encryption, bolstering access control, and establishing disaster recovery procedures.

 Given its risk score of 8, Botium Toys ought to give top priority to fixing these flaws in order to avert future security incidents and regulatory fines.
