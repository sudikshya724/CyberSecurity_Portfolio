Vulnerability Assessment Report
Date: January 1, 2025

Overview of the System
 The system being reviewed is a powerful server with 128GB of RAM and a powerful CPU.  It runs a MySQL database management system and the latest version of the Linux operating system.
 The server communicates over the network and engages with other systems via IPv4.  SSL/TLS encrypted data transmissions are one of the current security methods.

 Scope of the Assessment
 The evaluation of the system's access control methods is the specific emphasis of this vulnerability assessment.
 The three-month assessment period, which runs from June 20XX to August 20XX, follows the recommendations made by NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 for information system risk assessments.
Goal of the Assessment
Large amounts of data, such as campaign, analytics, and client data, are managed and stored by the server, which serves as a centralized data repository.
For marketing analysis and personalization initiatives, this data is essential. Making sure the server is secure is of utmost importance because it supports marketing operations.

Risk Assessment Table

Threat Source	Threat Event	Likelihood	Severity	Risk
Hacker	Data exfiltration of sensitive information	3	3	9
Employee	Interruption of mission-critical operations	2	3	6
Customer	Unauthorized alteration or deletion of data	1	3	3
Method of Risk Assessment
 The organization's approach to data management and storage was used to assess the hazards that were found.  By calculating the probability that events would occur as a result of the system's present access configurations, potential threats were examined.  Each incident's impact was evaluated according to how it would affect regular business operations.

 Plan for Remediation
 The following actions are advised in order to address the vulnerabilities that have been found:

 Enhancements to Authentication and Authorization: To ensure that only authorized users have access, enforce the use of strong passwords, use multi-factor authentication, and put role-based access controls in place.

 Auditing and Monitoring: To keep an eye on every database system access and activity, implement thorough logging and auditing procedures.
Data Encryption Upgrades:
Transition from SSL to TLS for improved encryption of data in transit.

Network Access Restrictions: To reduce exposure to the public internet, use IP allow-listing to limit database access to established IP ranges, such as corporate office networks.
