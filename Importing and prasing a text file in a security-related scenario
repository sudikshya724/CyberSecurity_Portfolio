Update a File Through a Python Algorithm
Project Description
In my organization, access to restricted digital content is managed through an allow list stored in a file named allow_list.txt, which contains approved IP addresses. 
To maintain this list, IP addresses that should no longer have access are stored in a separate remove list. I developed a Python algorithm to automate the process of updating the allow list
by removing any IP addresses found in the remove list.


# Step 1: Assign the file name
import_file = "allow_list.txt"

# Step 2: Open the file in read mode
file = open(import_file, "r")

# Step 3: Read all the contents of the file
ip_addresses = file.read()

# Step 4: Close the file
file.close()

# Step 5: Split the string into a list
ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

# Step 6: Remove each item in remove_list from the list
remove_list = ["192.168.1.1", "10.0.0.2"]  # You can replace with your actual list
for item in remove_list:
    if item in ip_addresses:
        ip_addresses.remove(item)

# Step 7: Join the list back into a string separated by newlines
ip_addresses = "\n".join(ip_addresses)

# Step 8: Open the file again in write mode
file = open(import_file, "w")

# Step 9: Write the updated IP list back into the file
file.write(ip_addresses)

# Step 10: Close the file again
file.close()

Summary
This algorithm efficiently manages access control by automatically removing unauthorized IP addresses from the allow_list.txt file. 
The steps included:

Reading the existing allow list file.

Converting the data to a manageable list format.

Iterating through a remove_list to identify and eliminate revoked IPs.

Writing the cleaned list back to the file using Python's built-in file handling methods.

This solution helps streamline system administration and ensures that only authorized users retain access to sensitive resources.
